## Invoice Ordering

If you need an invoice for personal or business purposes, in most countries/regions, the e-ticket confirmation is accepted as an invoice. For countries/regions with special requirements, you can use a dedicated form to order an invoice.

**Using E-Ticket Confirmation as Invoice**  
Your e-ticket confirmation is internationally recognized in most countries/regions (including Switzerland) as a receipt. It can be used for expense reimbursement and tax declaration purposes.

You can order your e-ticket confirmation under "Bookings" in your profile via the "Electronic Documents (Invoice)" or "Passenger Receipt" links.

**Ordering an Invoice After Booking**  
If you realize later that you need an invoice, we can send a new booking confirmation free of charge within 90 days after the ticket/documents have been fully used. After 90 days, a fee of 30 CHF per confirmation will apply (up to five e-ticket confirmations).

**Invoices for Greece, India, Italy, or Spain**  
For flights departing from Greece, India, Italy, or Spain, we can issue special invoices upon request. If the information on your e-ticket is considered insufficient, you may request an invoice in these countries.

## Credit Card

**Card Security Code**  
To make your online payment with a credit or debit card more secure, we require you to enter the card security code when booking online. This code checks the validity of your credit/debit card details.

- **American Express**: The security code is the 4-digit number above the card number on the front.
- **Mastercard**: The security code is the 3-digit number on the back in the signature area.
- **Visa**: The security code is the 3-digit number on the back in the signature area.
- **Diners Club**: The security code is the 3-digit number on the back in the signature area.
- **JCB**: The security code is the 3-digit number on the back in the signature area.
- **China UnionPay**: The 3-digit security code is found in the signature area on the back of the card.

## Card Security

**Payment Security Standards**  
In accordance with the new EU directive on payment services, we have enhanced our payment security standards to ensure a more secure online transaction environment in European countries/regions.

We comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), which defines how payment data—especially for credit and debit card transactions—must be stored, transmitted, and processed. This means all your payment data is encrypted according to the highest security standards.

**3-D Secure Authentication**  
To further increase security, all credit and debit cards issued in the European Economic Area (EEA) must now go through 3-D Secure authentication. This additional step ensures secure payments and reduces the risk of fraud.

**How Does 3-D Secure Work?**  
If you haven't registered yet, you’ll need to register your credit or debit card for this process.

- Register via your card-issuing bank’s website. The process may vary by bank.
- To complete the transaction, if 3-D Secure applies, you will be redirected to your bank’s website for additional verification.
- If you have any questions about registering your card for 3-D Secure, please contact your bank or card issuer directly.

## Pay by Invoice

### Who can use "Pay by Invoice"?
You must be at least 18 years old and a resident of Switzerland or the Principality of Liechtenstein. In addition, this payment option is only available for flights departing from Switzerland.

### What does the ID scan check, and where is it done?
The ID scan compares your ID with a selfie to prevent fraud and ensure that the person booking the flight is indeed the invoice recipient and not a victim of identity theft. You will receive a link via SMS to your smartphone. You can upload your documents and complete identity verification via this link.

### Do I need to perform an ID scan for every booking?
No. Once you have successfully completed the ID scan, you will not need to do it again for future bookings.

### Why did my ID scan fail?
Make sure the photo is clear, well-lit, and free from glare. Do not cover any part of the document. Also, take a recent personal photo of yourself.

### Can I retry a failed ID scan?
Yes. If your documents are not recognized, you can retry the ID scan.

### What are possible reasons the "Pay by Invoice" option is not authorized?
Our partner POWERPAY performs an online check for "Pay by Invoice." This check may result in a rejection for various reasons (e.g., credit status, conflicting information, or unpaid POWERPAY invoices). You can find more details on the POWERPAY website.

### How and when will I receive the POWERPAY invoice?
The invoice is issued by POWERPAY. You will receive a personal invoice via email about 24–48 hours after booking. This invoice is issued free of charge. If you pay it on time, there are no additional costs. Afterwards, unpaid balances from the received invoice will be consolidated into a monthly account statement. This will be mailed mid-month with a payment slip. A fee of CHF 2.90 is charged for issuing a monthly invoice.

### What is the payment deadline, and what are the reminder fees for non-payment?
**Personal invoice:** Must be paid within 15 days of email receipt. Payment is made via online banking. Payments at post office counters incur third-party fees.  
**Monthly invoice:** Payment is due by the end of the month with the payment slip.

### Can I make partial payments?
Yes. Both personal and monthly invoices can be paid partially. You may choose to pay between 10% and 100% of the total amount due.

### When are reminder fees applied, and how much are they?
If you miss the minimum payment for the monthly invoice:  
- First reminder fee: CHF 15  
- Second reminder fee: CHF 25

### How do I get a refund if I cancel a ticket?
That depends on when you cancel.

- If the invoice is already paid, you’ll receive a refund via bank transfer.
- If SWISS informs POWERPAY of the cancellation before the payment deadline, and the invoice is unpaid or partially paid, POWERPAY will send a new personal invoice with a new amount and deadline (if any unpaid amount remains).
- If SWISS informs POWERPAY after the payment deadline, and the invoice is unpaid or partially paid, MF Group will send you a monthly invoice with a CHF 2.90 fee minus the refund amount.

### Do I need to pay the invoice in full before boarding?
No. You can board your flight whether or not the POWERPAY invoice has been paid.

### Do you have any questions about the invoice?
If you have any questions about the invoice, please contact POWERPAY Customer Service:

## FAQ: Payments

### What are the advantages of using the currency conversion option?
- You decide which currency your credit card will be charged in.
- Daily exchange rates are shown and guaranteed at the time of payment.
- Credit card companies often charge extra fees for foreign currency payments. Paying in your card’s currency avoids these fees.

### Who benefits from currency conversion?
This option is only available when booking via swiss.com and not for flight changes, upgrades, or additional services (e.g., extra baggage) or tickets purchased through other channels. These are charged in the original currency of the departure airport.

### What exchange rate is used?
The total converted amount is based on daily rates from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). The rate may vary with new bookings or re-checking availability on swiss.com.

The exchange rate at the time of booking is final and will be shown on swiss.com and in your confirmation.

### Are there any other credit card fees?
Some banks may charge additional fees in specific cases. SWISS has no control over such charges.

### What currency is used for refunds?
Refunds are always issued in the currency in which the ticket was purchased.

## FAQ: European Fare Concept

### Are specific Economy fares ever fully booked?
No. As long as Economy Class seats are available, all three Economy fares will be available for booking.

### Can I book SWISS fares on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when switching from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g., Zurich–Lisbon with TAP)?
Economy Classic, Economy Flex, and Business Class fares can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light is only available on SWISS-operated flights (carrier code LX). Due to technical limitations, seat reservations cannot be made on codeshare flights.

### Why doesn’t SWISS offer Economy Flex fares for groups?
Group bookings can be changed to any fare option for free before ticketing, as long as the same fare is still available. Therefore, Economy Flex offers no extra benefit for groups.

### Can additional services (e.g., seat reservations, extra baggage) be changed later?
Not with Economy Light, as this fare cannot be changed. For Economy Classic, additional services can only be booked within the same reservation.

### Can I upgrade to Business Class with any Economy fare?
Yes. If you’ve booked Economy Light, Classic, or Flex, you can upgrade to Business Class, which includes many Business services. This can be done via swiss.com or SWISS Service Center.

### What should status customers (HON Circle, Senator, Frequent Travellers) know about fare options?
Economy Light does not include free advance seat reservations or extra baggage (e.g., golf equipment). Other status benefits, such as lounge access, remain valid.

### What about SWISS Golf Traveller members?
Golf baggage cannot be carried for free with the Economy Light fare.

### How do mileage earnings differ among fares?
Mileage accrual depends on the booking class, not the fare name.

### If I booked Economy Light and paid for extra baggage, then canceled the flight, do I lose everything?
Yes. Just like the fare itself, the fee for the first checked bag in Economy Light is non-refundable and cannot be transferred to another flight.

### If I booked Economy Classic without checked baggage, do I get a refund for unused baggage?
No. There is no refund for any unused services included in the fare.

### What’s the difference between first baggage and extra baggage?
The first checked bag is only purchasable with Economy Light and is cheaper than an extra bag.

### How can I purchase the first bag (up to 23kg) in Economy Light?
You can purchase it via a travel agency, swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure), or at the airport. Airport prices are higher. A separate fee applies for each flight segment.

### If asked to check a bag at the gate, can I still buy online at a lower price?
No. You can only purchase via swiss.com up to 1 hour before departure. Different rates apply at the airport.

### How many extra bags can I buy?
You can purchase up to two extra bags via swiss.com. Through a travel agency, you can buy one first bag plus one extra bag. Via the SWISS Service Center, there’s no limit on extra bags.

### What does "same-day change to an earlier flight" service in Economy Flex offer?
This applies to Economy Flex and Business Flex fares. On the day of departure, you can change to an earlier flight for free via lufthansa.com, the Lufthansa app, at the airport check-in kiosk, or check-in counter. Only valid for direct flights. Changing the route or airline is not allowed.
